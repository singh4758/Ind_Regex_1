1. What is Regex?
Ans:-  “A regular expression, regex or regexp is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern”.
Regular expressions are a way to search for patterns within data sets.

2. Is that regular expressions are NOT a programming language in itself?
Ans:- Regular expressions are a feature that is supported by almost all programming languages.
But by itself, it is not a programming language.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example1:-

foo|aaaa|bar
foo| aa |bar
foo|    | bar

a* ===> zero or more characters of 'a'(The character just precedencr the asterisk).

so the regex for this like be ====> foo a* bar   | there is no space it is only for clear visibility.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For writing regular expression there is few step we have to clear about that

Step1:-  The very first step would be to understand the requirement or the problem statement.
From the input text that is provided to us, what is it that needs to be included?
And what needs to be excluded?

Step2:- Once we are clear on this, we will move ahead to Step#2. Here we identify patterns
in the inclusion list or exclusion list. In the first example we found a pattern in the
inclusion list.But we should also look out for patterns in the exclusion list.
Sometimes it might just be easier to come up with a regex for the exclusion list, and
then negate that regex.

Step3:- Lets move ahead to Step#3. Here we use regex symbols to come up with a regex
pattern string that represents the inclusion list. We saw one such pattern a* in our first
example. We will be seeing many more such patterns in the examples to come.

Step4:- Once we have our regex pattern ready, we are going to move to our next step,
which is the 4th and final step. Here we use any regex engine from any programming
language to try out our regex pattern. All you need to do is to make sure you have the
input text file ready for consumption by the program.

In ubuntu terminal using grep command

grep 'regex with single quote' filename 
grep 'fooa*bar' input.txt
